    <h1>Bohemian Rhapsody</h1>
    <p>Is this the real life?
        <br>Is this just fantasy?
        <br>Caught in a landslide
        <br>No escape from reality
        <br>Open your eyes
        <br>Look up to the skies and see
        <br>I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
        <br>Because I'm easy come, easy go
        <br>A little high, little low
        <br>Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me</p>

    <p>Mama, just killed a man
        <br>Put a gun against his head
        <br>Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
        <br>Mama, life had just begun
        <br>Didn't mean to make you cry
        <br>Look up to the skies and see
        <br>I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
        <br>If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
        <br>Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters</p>
